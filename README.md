# GitHub Repository Cloner and Runner

This script automatically clones the GitHub repository at https://github.com/Beast000009/defiprogess, installs dependencies, and runs the application.

## Features

- Automatically clones the specified GitHub repository
- Detects the project type (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Installs dependencies based on the project type
- Attempts to run the application with appropriate commands
- Provides detailed status messages and error handling

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Make the script executable (Linux/Mac):
   ```
   chmod +x clone_and_run.py
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```
   ./clone_and_run.py
   ```
   or
   ```
   python3 clone_and_run.py
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Git installed and available in PATH
- Any additional requirements depend on the repository's project type

## How it works

1. The script first verifies that Git is installed
2. It clones the repository to a local directory
3. Based on files in the repository, it detects the project type
4. It installs dependencies using the appropriate package manager
5. It finds and executes the appropriate run command for the project

## Troubleshooting

If the script fails to run the project automatically:

1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Refer to the project's documentation for specific setup or run instructions
3. The project files are available in the `defiprogess` directory
